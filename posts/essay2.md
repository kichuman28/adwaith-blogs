Incendies has been in my watch-list for a very long time. I don't know what kept me away from this movie so long because after watching this I don't remember the last time a movie made me feel this way. 

Incendies focuses on the journey of Nawal Marwan, a single mother whose past is being uncovered by her twins after her death. Set against the backdrop of the Lebanese Civil War (I had to do some digging there), it shows the horrors the people had to endure... and the director does not hold back in that aspect. Definitely not for the faint of heart. 

For anyone who has not seen the movie reading this, I genuinely do not want to spoil this movie by describing about it further. It's best if you go in blind. Also, I think Lubna Azabal has entered into my list of favourite actresses of all time.
