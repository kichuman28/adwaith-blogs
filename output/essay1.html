      <p>I'm pretty sure Medium or Substack would've been perfect for what I'm trying to do with this... but it quite doesn't offer the individuality or uniqueness of having something as your own. This is not the first time I'm doing this. Those who know about oldrollvro, they know what I'm talking about. A lot of thoughts come across my mind and I believe it's important to write them down so later in life you can look back and reflect on your thoughts back then as a person. To see how much you've evolved. Introspection is something I'm working nowadays, and I believe with this I'm going on the right track.</p>
<p>What's my inspiration behind this? Paul Graham's essays of course. His minimalistic website for jotting down his thoughts was fascinating to me. Writing is a unique skill, to impact other people with your words is something I aim to achieve as a byproduct of this venture. This pretty much signifies a new start in my life, and I'll be documenting what's going on with each blog I write up. Consistency is not something I'm worried about, I don't wanna write because I HAVE to write. I want to write when it feels like it, when my mind is full of thoughts there's no other place for it go apart from this website. </p>
<p>I also love movies. The creativity that goes behind it. A movie is only as good as it's script, even if the idea is great. The number of ideas I've had for a movie is insane at this point, so I might drop some articles regarding all that too. </p>
<p>Now whatever I'm typing up feels like filler, so I'll stop it here for now. Not bad for a first article!</p>
